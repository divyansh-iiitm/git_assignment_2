# 8 Key GitHub Features

1.  **Repositories (Repos)**
    A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. It can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

2.  **Pull Requests (PRs)**
    Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

3.  **Issues**
    Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They're like a to-do list for your repository where you can assign tasks to specific users and label them for organization.

4.  **GitHub Actions**
    GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. You can build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

5.  **Forks**
    A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

6.  **Gists**
    Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and pastes with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means it can be forked and cloned.

7.  **Wiki**
    Every GitHub repository comes with a section for hosting documentation, called a Wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, like how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles.

8.  **Insights**
    The Insights tab gives you a visual representation of the project's activity. You can see who has contributed the most, when the commits were made, and track the health of the project.
